# ES14
ECMAScript 2023 (also known as ES14) is the most recent version of the standard that defines the JavaScript language. It was officially approved in June 2023 by TC39, the committee that maintains and develops ECMAScript. Among its main features and improvements are the following:


1. **Array and TypedArray methods** `findLast` and `findLastIndex`: These methods allow you to search for the last element of an array that meets a condition. They work similarly to `find` and `findIndex`, but instead of starting the search from the beginning, they search from the end.
    * `findLast`: returns the last element that meets the condition.
    * `findLastIndex`: returns the index of the last element that meets the condition.

1. **`toSorted`, `toReversed`, `toSpliced` and `with` in Arrays**: These methods provide immutable ways to modify arrays.
    * `toSorted`: creates a new ordered copy of the array without modifying the original.
    * `toReversed`: returns a copy of the inverted array.
    * `toSpliced`: allows you to perform an operation similar to `splice`, but without modifying the original array..
    * `with`: returns a copy of the array with a replaced element at a specific position.

1. **`Symbol.prototype.description`**: This allows you to get the description of a symbol 
directly using the `description` property, making it easier to read and understand.

1. **Handling `Error.cause`**: Error objects (`Error`) can now accept a cause property that allows you to indicate the cause of an error. 
This is useful for tracking down errors or debugging when one error triggers another.

1. **`hashbang` (`#!)`**: ECMAScript 2023 adds support for hashbang (or shebang) 
in JavaScript files. This allows you to specify the interpreter path on the first 
line of a JavaScript file, useful for scripts run in command-line environments.

1. **Methods and improvements in `Intl`**: Added improvements to Intl for text 
localization and formatting, including new methods for time, calendar, 
and date formats, which help improve internationalization (i18n) of applications.

1. **Data Structures: `Map.prototype.emplace`**: `Map.prototype.emplace`
The `place` method was introduced for `Map`, which allows you to add or modify 
a value in the map if it is not present, without having to do additional checks.

1. **Performance improvements and optimization**: Aside from the new features, ECMAScript 2023 also includes several performance and optimization 
improvements that JavaScript engines implement to run code more efficiently.
Performance improvements and optimization

ECMAScript 2023 remains backward 
compatible, so many of these features are optional improvements and do not force 
changes to existing code.
